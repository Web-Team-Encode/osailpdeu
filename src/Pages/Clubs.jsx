    // ? In figma "clubs" is given in navbar, and for clubs page, they have made this page in which they have written "Committees under S&T" but in the navbar, they have written "Clubs" so I am confused about this. So I am planning to made 2 pages "Clubs under S&T" and "Clubs under S&C" and then we can add the navbar links to them or maybe a dropdown in navbar for clubs. What do you think about this?
    // ? I think we should go for 2 different pages for clubs under S&T and S&C. What do you think about this?
